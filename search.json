    "section": "",
    "text": "The Ballon d’Or is widely considered the most prestigious individual award in football, and every year, fans, players, and experts eagerly anticipate the announcement of the winner. However, the 2020 Ballon d’Or was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on football. This means that the 2021 Ballon d’Or will recognize the best performances from 2020 and the first half of 2021.\nAnother player who could challenge for the Ballon d’Or is Cristiano Ronaldo, who had a solid season with Juventus in 2020. He scored 31 goals in 33 appearances for the club and helped them win the Serie A title. He was also impressive in the Champions League, scoring twice in the round of 16 against Lyon. Ronaldo has won the Ballon d’Or five times in his career and will be eager to add to his collection this year.\nOther players who could be in the running for the Ballon d’Or include Kevin De Bruyne, who played a pivotal role in Manchester City’s Premier League title win and their run to the Champions League final, and N’Golo Kante, who was outstanding for Chelsea in their Champions League triumph.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2 ──\n✔ ggplot2 3.4.0      ✔ purrr   1.0.1 \n✔ tibble  3.1.8      ✔ dplyr   1.0.10\n✔ tidyr   1.2.1      ✔ stringr 1.5.0 \n✔ readr   2.1.3      ✔ forcats 0.5.2 \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(ggalt)\n\n\nRegistered S3 methods overwritten by 'ggalt':\n  method                  from   \n  grid.draw.absoluteGrob  ggplot2\n  grobHeight.absoluteGrob ggplot2\n  grobWidth.absoluteGrob  ggplot2\n  grobX.absoluteGrob      ggplot2\n  grobY.absoluteGrob      ggplot2\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\n\n\nWarning: package 'ggbeeswarm' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(worldfootballR)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nbig5shooting <- fb_big5_advanced_season_stats(season_end_year=2020,stat_type=\"shooting\",team_or_player=\"player\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\ngoals <- big5shooting %>%\n  filter(Gls_Standard > 2)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nRL1 <- goals %>% filter(Player == \"Robert Lewandowski\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nCI <- goals %>% filter(Player == \"Ciro Immobile\")\n\n\nLewandowski scored a stunning 55 goals in 47 appearances across all competitions for his club and country in 2020. He played a crucial role in Bayern Munich’s dominant season, helping them win the Bundesliga title for the eighth consecutive year, the DFB-Pokal Cup, and the UEFA Champions League.\nIn the Bundesliga, Lewandowski finished as the top scorer for the fifth time in his career, scoring an incredible 34 goals in just 31 appearances. He broke Gerd Muller’s long-standing record of 40 goals in a single season in the Bundesliga, which had stood since 1971-72. His performances helped Bayern Munich finish the season with a record 100 goals scored, and they won the title by a comfortable margin of 13 points.\nIn the DFB-Pokal Cup, Lewandowski scored six goals in five appearances, including a hat-trick in the final against Bayer Leverkusen, which Bayern Munich won 4-2. His three goals in the final made him the first player to score a hat-trick in a DFB-Pokal Cup final since 1982.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=goals, aes(x=Gls_Standard, y=Comp), size = 3, color=\"green\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=RL1, aes(x=Gls_Standard, y=Comp), size = 3, color=\"red\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=CI, aes(x=Gls_Standard, y=Comp), size = 3, color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(data=RL1, aes(x=33, y=1.5, label=Player)) +\n  geom_text(data=CI, aes(x=33, y=4.8, label=Player)) +\n  #geom_text(data=RL1, aes(x=Mins_Per_90, y=xG_Expected, label=Player)) +\n  #geom_encircle(data=RL1, aes(x=Mins_Per_90, y=xG_Expected), s_shape=.1, expand=.01, colour=\"Purple\")+  \n  labs(x=\"Player\", y=\"Goals Scored\", title=\"2020 Top Goalscorers\", subtitle=\"Top 5 Goalscorers During The COVID Season\", caption=\"Source: World Football | By Mykel Nayeri\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nxG <- big5shooting %>%\n  filter(xG_Expected > 20)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nRL <- xG %>% filter(Player == \"Robert Lewandowski\")\n\n\nIn the UEFA Champions League, Lewandowski was simply outstanding, scoring 15 goals in 10 appearances to help Bayern Munich win the competition for the sixth time in their history. He scored in every round of the competition, including two goals in the final against Paris Saint-Germain, which Bayern Munich won 1-0. His 15 goals in the Champions League set a new record for the most goals scored in a single season in the competition’s history.\nLewandowski’s incredible performances throughout the 2020 season earned him several individual awards and accolades. He was named the UEFA Men’s Player of the Year for the first time in his career, beating off competition from Kevin De Bruyne and Manuel Neuer. He was also named the Best FIFA Men’s Player.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=big5shooting, aes(x=Mins_Per_90, y=xG_Expected), color=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=RL, aes(x=Mins_Per_90, y=xG_Expected), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text(data=RL, aes(x=Mins_Per_90, y=xG_Expected, label=Player)) +\n  geom_encircle(data=RL, aes(x=Mins_Per_90, y=xG_Expected), s_shape=.1, expand=.01, colour=\"Purple\")+ \n  labs(x=\"Player Data\", y=\"Expected Goals Scored\", title=\"2020 Top Expected Goalscorers\", subtitle=\"2020 Top 5 Soccer Stat Leaders for Goals They Are Expected To Score.\", caption=\"Source: World Football | By Mykel Nayeri\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\nWarning: Removed 1 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nbig5possession <- fb_big5_advanced_season_stats(season_end_year=2020,stat_type=\"possession\",team_or_player=\"player\") \n\n\n\n\nCode\nftc <- big5possession %>%\n  filter(Final_Third_Carries > 100)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nLM <- ftc %>% filter(Player == \"Lionel Messi\")\n\n\nThe 2021 Ballon d’Or race promises to be highly competitive, with many players staking their claim as potential winners. One of the frontrunners for the award is Lionel Messi, who had another impressive season with Barcelona in 2020. Despite Barcelona’s struggles in La Liga, Messi was once again their standout performer, scoring 30 goals and providing 11 assists in 35 appearances. He also won the Copa del Rey, scoring twice in the final against Athletic Bilbao.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=ftc, aes(x=reorder(Player, Final_Third_Carries), weight=Final_Third_Carries)) + \n  geom_bar(data=ftc, aes(x=reorder(Player, Final_Third_Carries), weight=Final_Third_Carries),fill=\"light grey\") + \n  geom_bar(data=LM, aes(x=reorder(Player, Final_Third_Carries), weight=Final_Third_Carries),fill=\"maroon\") + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = \"maroon\") +\n  coord_flip()+ \n  labs(x=\"Player\", y=\"Final Third Carries\", title=\"Carrying The Ball In The Final Third\", subtitle=\"Top 5 Final Third Carries In 2020\", caption=\"Source: World Football | By Mykel Nayeri\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n)"

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Ballon d’Or is widely considered the most prestigious individual award in football, and every year, fans, players, and experts eagerly anticipate the announcement of the winner. However, the 2020 Ballon d’Or was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on football. This means that the 2021 Ballon d’Or will recognize the best performances from 2020 and the first half of 2021.\nThe 2021 Ballon d’Or race promises to be highly competitive, with many players staking their claim as potential winners. One of the frontrunners for the award is Lionel Messi, who had another impressive season with Barcelona in 2020. Despite Barcelona’s struggles in La Liga, Messi was once again their standout performer, scoring 30 goals and providing 11 assists in 35 appearances. He also won the Copa del Rey, scoring twice in the final against Athletic Bilbao.\nAnother strong contender for the award is Robert Lewandowski, who had a phenomenal season with Bayern Munich in 2020. As I mentioned earlier, he scored 55 goals in 47 appearances for the club, including 34 goals in the Bundesliga and 15 goals in the Champions League. He was instrumental in Bayern’s success in both competitions and was widely considered one of the best players in the world that year.\nAnother player who could challenge for the Ballon d’Or is Cristiano Ronaldo, who had a solid season with Juventus in 2020. He scored 31 goals in 33 appearances for the club and helped them win the Serie A title. He was also impressive in the Champions League, scoring twice in the round of 16 against Lyon. Ronaldo has won the Ballon d’Or five times in his career and will be eager to add to his collection this year.\nOther players who could be in the running for the Ballon d’Or include Kevin De Bruyne, who played a pivotal role in Manchester City’s Premier League title win and their run to the Champions League final, and N’Golo Kante, who was outstanding for Chelsea in their Champions League triumph.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2 ──\n✔ ggplot2 3.4.0      ✔ purrr   1.0.1 \n✔ tibble  3.1.8      ✔ dplyr   1.0.10\n✔ tidyr   1.2.1      ✔ stringr 1.5.0 \n✔ readr   2.1.3      ✔ forcats 0.5.2 \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(ggalt)\n\n\nRegistered S3 methods overwritten by 'ggalt':\n  method                  from   \n  grid.draw.absoluteGrob  ggplot2\n  grobHeight.absoluteGrob ggplot2\n  grobWidth.absoluteGrob  ggplot2\n  grobX.absoluteGrob      ggplot2\n  grobY.absoluteGrob      ggplot2\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\n\n\nWarning: package 'ggbeeswarm' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(worldfootballR)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nbig5shooting <- fb_big5_advanced_season_stats(season_end_year=2020,stat_type=\"shooting\",team_or_player=\"player\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\ngoals <- big5shooting %>%\n  filter(Gls_Standard > 2)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nRL1 <- goals %>% filter(Player == \"Robert Lewandowski\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nCI <- goals %>% filter(Player == \"Ciro Immobile\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=goals, aes(x=Gls_Standard, y=Comp), size = 3, color=\"green\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=RL1, aes(x=Gls_Standard, y=Comp), size = 3, color=\"red\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=CI, aes(x=Gls_Standard, y=Comp), size = 3, color=\"blue\") +\n\n  #geom_text(data=RL1, aes(x=Mins_Per_90, y=xG_Expected, label=Player)) +\n  #geom_encircle(data=RL1, aes(x=Mins_Per_90, y=xG_Expected), s_shape=.1, expand=.01, colour=\"Purple\")+  \n  labs(x=\"Player\", y=\"Goals Scored\", title=\"2020 Top Goalscorers\", subtitle=\"Top 5 Goalscorers During The COVID Season\", caption=\"Source: World Football | By Mykel Nayeri\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nxG <- big5shooting %>%\n  filter(xG_Expected > 20)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nRL <- xG %>% filter(Player == \"Robert Lewandowski\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=big5shooting, aes(x=Mins_Per_90, y=xG_Expected), color=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=RL, aes(x=Mins_Per_90, y=xG_Expected), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text(data=RL, aes(x=Mins_Per_90, y=xG_Expected, label=Player)) +\n  geom_encircle(data=RL, aes(x=Mins_Per_90, y=xG_Expected), s_shape=.1, expand=.01, colour=\"Purple\")+ \n  labs(x=\"Player Data\", y=\"Expected Goals Scored\", title=\"2020 Top Expected Goalscorers\", subtitle=\"2020 Top 5 Soccer Stat Leaders for Goals They Are Expected To Score.\", caption=\"Source: World Football | By Mykel Nayeri\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\nWarning: Removed 1 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nbig5possession <- fb_big5_advanced_season_stats(season_end_year=2020,stat_type=\"possession\",team_or_player=\"player\") \n\n\n\n\nCode\nftc <- big5possession %>%\n  filter(Final_Third_Carries > 100)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nLM <- ftc %>% filter(Player == \"Lionel Messi\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=ftc, aes(x=reorder(Player, Final_Third_Carries), weight=Final_Third_Carries)) + \n  geom_bar(data=LM, aes(x=reorder(Player, Final_Third_Carries), weight=Final_Third_Carries),fill=\"red\") + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = \"red\") +\n  coord_flip()+ \n  labs(x=\"Player\", y=\"Final Third Carries\", title=\"Carrying The Ball In The Final Third\", subtitle=\"Top 5 Final Third Carries In 2020\", caption=\"Source: World Football | By Mykel Nayeri\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n)"

    "text": "St. Louis City’s attack is spearheaded by Klauss and Jared Stroud. Klauss is currently the second-highest goalscorer in the MLS with five goals and has registered 30 possessions in the opposition’s penalty area, the second-highest in the league. He also boasts the best shooting grade among forwards and ranks third overall in the MLS with a grade of 90.3. Stroud, on the other hand, has scored two goals and has generated five goalscoring chances. He leads the league in shooting grade at 91.8 and has improved his ball carry grade to 75.4 this season from 67.7 in his last full season with Austin FC in 2021. Together, Klauss and Stroud are the only players from the same team to rank in the top 10 of the MLS shot grades, occupying the first and third positions.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(worldfootballR)\nmls_shooting <- fb_season_team_stats(country = \"USA\", gender = \"M\", season_end_year = \"2023\", tier = \"1st\", stat_type = \"shooting\")\ngoals <- mls_shooting %>%\nfilter(Team_or_Opponent == \"team\", Gls_Standard > 10)\n  STL <- mls_shooting %>% filter(Squad == \"St. Louis\")\nggplot() + \n  geom_lollipop(data=goals, aes(x=Gls_Standard, y=Squad), horizontal = TRUE) +\n  geom_lollipop(data=STL, aes(x=Gls_Standard, y=Squad), horizontal = TRUE,\n  size = 1, color=\"#E0004D\")+\n  geom_text(data=STL, aes(x=33, y=1.5, label=\"hello\")) +\n  #geom_text(data=STL, aes(x=Gls_Standard, y=Squad, label=Squad)) +\n  #geom_encircle(data=STL, aes(x=Gls_Standard, y=Squad), s_shape=.1, expand=.01, colour=\"Purple\")+  \n  labs(x=\"Goals Scored\", y=\"Squad\", title=\"The SC In STLSC Means Scoring Club\", subtitle=\"Highest scoring teams throughout the start of The 2023 MLS season.\", caption=\"Source: World Football | By Mykel Nayeri\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nSt. Louis City’s Eduard Löwen, one of their two Designated Players, has been a key player in their midfield this season. The former Vfl Bochum player has recorded one goal, three assists, and eight key passes. His playmaking abilities are evident in his 32 completed line-breaking passes, which rank him T-18th out of 305 players. Löwen has also achieved a crossing grade of 76.0, which is the sixth-highest among 66 players in his position, and a passing grade of 73.5. However, his defensive record has not been as impressive, as he has only won 33% of his challenges, including defending two out of nine dribbles and winning three out of 14 aerial duels. His challenger grade currently stands at 67.1, which is ranked 54th among midfielders. Despite this, Löwen’s overall grading profile is still better than most midfielders, although it does not reach an elite level.\n\n\nCode\nmls_possession <- fb_season_team_stats(country = \"USA\", gender = \"M\", season_end_year = \"2023\", tier = \"1st\", stat_type = \"possession\")\npossession <- mls_possession %>%\n  filter(Team_or_Opponent == \"team\", Poss > 50)\n  STL2 <- mls_possession %>% filter(Squad == \"St. Louis\")\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=possession, aes(x=Poss, y=Squad), color=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=possession, aes(x=Poss, y=Squad), color=\"light grey\")+\n  geom_point(data=STL2, aes(x=Poss, y=Squad), color=\"#FEDB00\") +\n  labs(x=\"Possession Pecentage\", y=\"Squad\", title=\"Possession Does Not Equal Success\", subtitle=\"St. Louis is a mid-table team based on possession but still find success.\", caption=\"Source: World Football | By Mykel Nayeri\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nSt. Louis SC has given up only four goals in five games, thanks in large part to their consistent centre-back pairing. Tim Parker, who joined the team this season, has been a standout performer, winning 68% of his challenges and 13 of 19 aerial duels. His overall PFF challenge grade of 82.3 is the 12th-best among centre-backs in the league. However, his passing has been below average, with a true passing percentage of 76% ranking him 48th among qualifying centre-backs. He has made up for this by taking chances with his passes, ranking sixth overall in line-breaking passes attempted. Meanwhile, Kyle Heibert has been impressive in his MLS debut season, winning 75% of his challenges and producing a Challenger grade of 87.4, the third-best among qualified centre-backs. His passing has also featured line-breaking passes, ranking 14th overall in the league, although his true pass completion percentage of 75% ranks 56th.\n\n\nCode\nmls_defense <- fb_season_team_stats(country = \"USA\", gender = \"M\", season_end_year = \"2023\", tier = \"1st\", stat_type = \"defense\")\ndefense <- mls_defense %>%\n  filter(Team_or_Opponent == \"team\", Int > 100)\n  STL3 <- mls_defense %>% filter(Squad == \"St. Louis\")\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=defense, aes(x=reorder(Squad, Int), weight=Int)) + \n  geom_bar(data=defense, aes(x=reorder(Squad, Int), weight=Int),fill=\"light grey\") + \n  geom_bar(data=STL3, aes(x=reorder(Squad, Int), weight=Int),fill=\"#0C2340\") + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = \"#0C2340\") +\n  coord_flip()+ \n  labs(x=\"Squad\", y=\"Interceptions\", title=\"St. Louis Wants The Ball Back\", subtitle=\"St. Louis is the seventh leading team in the MLS at interceptions.\", caption=\"Source: World Football | By Mykel Nayeri\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, St. Louis City SC has a real shot at the US Open Cup, MLS Supporters Shield, and MLS Cup if they can keep their pieces together throughout the season and the goals keep coming. For their first season as an expansion franchise, they are paving the way for other clubs coming down the road."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Ballon d’Or is widely considered the most prestigious individual award in football, and every year, fans, players, and experts eagerly anticipate the announcement of the winner. However, the 2020 Ballon d’Or was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on football. This means that the 2021 Ballon d’Or will recognize the best performances from 2020 and the first half of 2021.\nAnother player who could challenge for the Ballon d’Or is Cristiano Ronaldo, who had a solid season with Juventus in 2020. He scored 31 goals in 33 appearances for the club and helped them win the Serie A title. He was also impressive in the Champions League, scoring twice in the round of 16 against Lyon. Ronaldo has won the Ballon d’Or five times in his career and will be eager to add to his collection this year.\nOther players who could be in the running for the Ballon d’Or include Kevin De Bruyne, who played a pivotal role in Manchester City’s Premier League title win and their run to the Champions League final, and N’Golo Kante, who was outstanding for Chelsea in their Champions League triumph.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2 ──\n✔ ggplot2 3.4.0      ✔ purrr   1.0.1 \n✔ tibble  3.1.8      ✔ dplyr   1.0.10\n✔ tidyr   1.2.1      ✔ stringr 1.5.0 \n✔ readr   2.1.3      ✔ forcats 0.5.2 \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(ggalt)\n\n\nRegistered S3 methods overwritten by 'ggalt':\n  method                  from   \n  grid.draw.absoluteGrob  ggplot2\n  grobHeight.absoluteGrob ggplot2\n  grobWidth.absoluteGrob  ggplot2\n  grobX.absoluteGrob      ggplot2\n  grobY.absoluteGrob      ggplot2\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\n\n\nWarning: package 'ggbeeswarm' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(worldfootballR)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nbig5shooting <- fb_big5_advanced_season_stats(season_end_year=2020,stat_type=\"shooting\",team_or_player=\"player\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\ngoals <- big5shooting %>%\n  filter(Gls_Standard > 2)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nRL1 <- goals %>% filter(Player == \"Robert Lewandowski\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nCI <- goals %>% filter(Player == \"Ciro Immobile\")\n\n\nLewandowski scored a stunning 55 goals in 47 appearances across all competitions for his club and country in 2020. He played a crucial role in Bayern Munich’s dominant season, helping them win the Bundesliga title for the eighth consecutive year, the DFB-Pokal Cup, and the UEFA Champions League.\nIn the Bundesliga, Lewandowski finished as the top scorer for the fifth time in his career, scoring an incredible 34 goals in just 31 appearances. He broke Gerd Muller’s long-standing record of 40 goals in a single season in the Bundesliga, which had stood since 1971-72. His performances helped Bayern Munich finish the season with a record 100 goals scored, and they won the title by a comfortable margin of 13 points.\nIn the DFB-Pokal Cup, Lewandowski scored six goals in five appearances, including a hat-trick in the final against Bayer Leverkusen, which Bayern Munich won 4-2. His three goals in the final made him the first player to score a hat-trick in a DFB-Pokal Cup final since 1982.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=goals, aes(x=Gls_Standard, y=Comp), size = 3, color=\"green\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=RL1, aes(x=Gls_Standard, y=Comp), size = 3, color=\"red\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=CI, aes(x=Gls_Standard, y=Comp), size = 3, color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(data=RL1, aes(x=33, y=1.5, label=Player)) +\n  geom_text(data=CI, aes(x=33, y=4.8, label=Player)) +\n  #geom_text(data=RL1, aes(x=Mins_Per_90, y=xG_Expected, label=Player)) +\n  #geom_encircle(data=RL1, aes(x=Mins_Per_90, y=xG_Expected), s_shape=.1, expand=.01, colour=\"Purple\")+  \n  labs(x=\"Player\", y=\"Goals Scored\", title=\"2020 Top Goalscorers\", subtitle=\"Top 5 Goalscorers During The COVID Season\", caption=\"Source: World Football | By Mykel Nayeri\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nxG <- big5shooting %>%\n  filter(xG_Expected > 20)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nRL <- xG %>% filter(Player == \"Robert Lewandowski\")\n\n\nIn the UEFA Champions League, Lewandowski was simply outstanding, scoring 15 goals in 10 appearances to help Bayern Munich win the competition for the sixth time in their history. He scored in every round of the competition, including two goals in the final against Paris Saint-Germain, which Bayern Munich won 1-0. His 15 goals in the Champions League set a new record for the most goals scored in a single season in the competition’s history.\nLewandowski’s incredible performances throughout the 2020 season earned him several individual awards and accolades.

One of the frontrunners for the award is Lionel Messi, who had another impressive season with Barcelona in 2020. Despite Barcelona’s struggles in La Liga, Messi was once again their standout performer, scoring 30 goals and providing 11 assists in 35 appearances.
